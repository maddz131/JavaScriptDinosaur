# Object Oriented Javascript 

## Dinosaur Infograph

As a part of the Udacity Intermediate Javascript Nanodegree course I built an infographic derived from data that was provided, as well as user input data. I pulled in information from a form and used it to complete an array of objects that will then be appended back to the DOM. 

For the project, I generated a 3x3 grid of tiles (9 in total) with the human in the center tile. Each tile contains a title, the species, an image, and a fact. For the human tile, the name of the human is displayed, rather than the species. When the user clicks to generate the infographic from the form, the grid will appear and the form will be hidden. The facts displayed are random per dinosaur with an opportunity of displaying at least 6 different types of facts. One of the titles is for a pigeon in which the tile always displays, “All birds are considered dinosaurs.”

The majority of my work was done in the app.js file. Some items, such as the dino.json and app.css were provided.
